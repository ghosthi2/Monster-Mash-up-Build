Hello gamers, we hope you enjoy playing this build of the game, buggy as it is. Controls are in the game already.
ALl you gotta do is unzip the ZIP file and access the application (or .exe) file in the resulting folder.
Unfortunately, this build only works for Windows so if you're using Linux or Mac, phone a friend,
borrow their Windows machine, and play with them too if you can!

Thank you again for playing. We hope you like our game!

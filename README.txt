Hello gamers, we hope you enjoy playing this build of the game, buggy as it is. Controls are in the game already.

The build can be downloaded from here:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IvsHecEv_j3dUDoHkPvBBftKPbGJU71r

ALl you gotta do is download the ZIP file. Unzip the ZIP file and then run the application (or .exe) file in the resulting folder.
That file should be called Monster Mash-up Master

Unfortunately, this build only works for Windows so if you're using Linux or Mac, phone a friend,
borrow their Windows machine, and play with them too if you can!

Thank you again for playing. We hope you like our game!

Also, there is no exit button. Sooo just alt+F4 outta there once you're done lol.
